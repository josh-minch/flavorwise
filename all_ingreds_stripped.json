salt. Place in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or paper towels and set over a bowl to drain excess liquid. Reserve strained tomato juice for another purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn broiler on high to preheat. Place the largest cast iron skillet you have under the broiler, on the stove over maximum heat, or on a ripping hot grill. After about  minutes, both the broiler and the skillet should be hot enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoll out or stretch pizza dough as thin as possible on a floured cookie sheet.  Immediately top with tomatoes, sopressata, and mozzarella, torn into large chunks.\n\n\n\n\n\nInvert skillet and transfer pizza to underside. Slide under the broiler as close to the heating element as possible without generating copious smoke. Cook until dough is puffy and well-charred, about  or  minutes, rotating skillet  degrees halfway through cooking to brown crust evenly.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove excess flour from crust with a pastry brush and transfer pizza to a plate. Top with finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, basil, and a light drizzle of olive oil. Slice and serve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Bread Recipes\n\n\nThe Secret Ingredient : Pink Peppercorn and Parmesan Goug\u00e8res\nCranberry Orange Biscuits\nBread Baking: Whole Wheat Sandwich Loaf\nSunday Brunch: Zwiebelkuchen\nTarte aux Tomates \nView All Bread Recipes\n\n\n\n\nMore Pizza Recipes\n\n\nTarte aux Tomates \nGrilled Sausage and Ricotta Pizza Sandwich\nEasy Pan Pizza With Zucchini, Red Onion, and Pistachios \nFully Loaded Pizza Macaroni and Cheese\nGrilled Pizza With Grilled Tomatoes, Asparagus, Goat Cheese, and Marcona Almonds\nView All Pizza Recipes\n\n\n\n\nAll products linked here have been independently selected by our editors.

flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Pulse several times to combine. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the butter; pulse several more times, then process for a few seconds to form mealy crumbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a small bowl, beat together the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla. Pour this egg mixture into the processor; pulse several times to mix it in, then process for about  seconds. Stir the mixture up from the bottom with a rubber spatula, then process again until the dough begins to clump together, about  seconds more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface and, with floured hands, press dough together, divide in half, form into  disks. Wrap each disk with plastic wrap; refrigerate for at least  hour or up to  days. \n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare the filling: In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the chocolate and butter together, stirring until perfectly smooth. Add the salt, vanilla, sugar, eggs, flour, and walnuts; stir until well blended. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf baking all the hamantaschen at once, on two baking sheets, position the oven racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven. If making only one sheet at a time, the rack should be in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to \u00b0F. Dab the corners of the baking sheets with butter; line them with parchment paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the dough is coming straight from the refrigerator, let it warm slightly at room temperature  so it can be rolled out. On a lightly floured board, roll dough to  inch thick. With a -inch round cookie cutter, cut circles of dough, and place them on the prepared sheets.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace about   of filling in the center of each circle. Brush perimeter of circle with egg wash. Using a dough scraper, lift dough to partially cover the filling, spacing it at one-third intervals, like a tri-cornered hat. Brush the tops of the formed cookies with egg wash.\n\n\n\n\n\nBake  to  minutes or until the cookies are golden brown. If baking more than one sheet at a time, rotate sheets top to bottom and front to back toward the end of the baking time to ensure even browning.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove from oven; let rest on baking sheets for  or  minutes.

Alternatively, you could put the beans in a pot with the same amount of water, bring to a boil, and boil hard for  minutes; then cover, turn off the heat, and let the pot sit, covered, for  hour. I never soak beans overnight, always using the second method instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrain the beans and put them in a large pot with    fresh water. Add the garlic, half of the diced pepper, and   plus   chopped cilantro. Bring to a boil. Cover partially, adjust heat so the liquid simmers quite gently, and cook until the beans are fairly tender . Stir in   salt and cook another  minutes, until the beans are very tender. Drain the beans.\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the oil in a pot or skillet large enough to hold all the ingredients and set over medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and remaining bell pepper. Stir and fry until the onion is translucent, turning the heat down if it begins to brown. Add the remaining cilantro  and stir for a minute; then add the beans. Stir for  minutes, breaking up any clumps, and then add the rice. Stir to break up clumps of rice. Add salt and pepper to taste and continue to stir and fry until the rice and beans are heated through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Bean and Pulse Recipes\n\n\nItalian Sausage with Cannellini Beans and Pickled Peppers\nCook the Book: New Orleans Style Red Beans\nSweet Potato and Black Bean Chilaquiles\nDinner Tonight: Scallops with Corn and Fava Bean Succotash\nCook the Book: Lentils with Pancetta\nView All Bean and Pulse Recipes\n\n\n\n\nMore Rice Recipes\n\n\nSaffron and Lemon Risotto From 'One Good Dish'\nDinner Tonight: Crab Fried Rice\nGinger Brown Rice Pudding\nEat for Eight Bucks: Coconut-Vegetable Rice Pilaf with Peppercorns\nCook the Book: Jasmine Rice Pudding\nView All Rice Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Recipe Appears In\nBest Of 'Sack Lunch'\n\nAll products linked here have been independently selected by our editors.
