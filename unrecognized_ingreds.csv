A Note on Some Ingredients
Think ahead when using store-bought puff pastry.  The best way to do so is by tossing the pastry from the freezer to the fridge before you go to sleep.  It will be perfect in the morning.
"To toast nuts, I usually scatter the nuts on a baking sheet and place them in an oven between  and °F for  minutes.  You can also toast them in a dry pan. When you can smell them and they begin to get golden cheeks, they're ready. I often toast more then I need, then store them in the freezer to keep them from spoiling."
